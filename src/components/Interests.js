      <p>
        I spend most of my time outdoors because, let's face it, data isn't the only thing that needs exploring! I love traveling, not just to new places, but also to new perspectives and, of course, finding the best local food.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not globe-trotting or building my social network, you'll find me on the badminton court, perfecting my serve â€“ or glued to the latest science tech breakthroughs, because who doesn't love a little geeky fun on the side.
